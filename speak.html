     I have 5 years of Web technology experience, so I am familiar with JavaScipt and HTML. In my daily work, the most commonly used technology is Vue and its family library, and I also have some understanding of React. Of course, I also have some understanding of other programming languages, such as NodeJS, Python and Java, but I have not used them in real project
    In my current company,My main job is to take charge of front-end project development. At the same time, I also like to pay attention to some popular technologies, such as Docker. I built the continuous integration and continuous deployment based on GitLab and GitLab-Runner for the company
    That's all. Hope a happy interview '`
